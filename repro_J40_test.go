// Nodes p and a lie in this order between head and tail, and n and m are
// alone. Appending n after p stops at "add.cas1" of its first try, before it
// changes p.next from a to n. p is then marked for deletion to its end, so
// p.next is a with the mark. The append resumes: its first CAS fails, and its
// retry reloads p.next, a with the mark, and uses it as the expected value of
// its next CAS, which changes p.next to n without the mark, and stops at
// "add.cas2". Appending m after p now sees no mark on p.next, links m between
// p and n, and returns nil. The append of n resumes: its second CAS, on the
// prev of a with the mark, fails, its rollback fails because p.next is m, and
// its next retry links n between p and m. Both appends return nil, but p is
// deleted and neither n nor m can be reached from head. p.next must keep its
// mark, and a node an append returns nil for must be in the list.
